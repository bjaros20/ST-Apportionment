# Single Sales Factor Apportionment Project

This repository contains replication materials for  
**“The Impact of Single Sales Factor Apportionment on State Tax Revenues: Short- and Long-Run Effects”** (2025).

This is my first major project and also my job market paper. I reorganized what was previously a private repo and made it public in the interest of transparency and to enhance replicability for anyone interested in the topic. That said, the reorganization process probably made the repo a little more convoluted than ideal. If you run into issues or have suggestions for improving the structure, feel free to contact me. I’d welcome your input.

## Structure

- `analysis/` – Organized by paper sections.
- `data/raw/` – Original state-level datasets.
- `data/filtered/` – Cleaned datasets prepared for analysis.
- `scripts/` – General scripts not yet tied to a specific section.
- `archive/` – Miscellaneous or historical files (not used in replication).
- `output/` – Tables and figures saved by scripts.

## Replication Guide

A detailed mapping from data → scripts → results is in  
[`DATA_INVENTORY.md`](DATA_INVENTORY.md).
