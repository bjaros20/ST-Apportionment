title: "Tax Base Results- All Bases, Multiple Emp Approaches- SSFA"
output: html_notebook
date: "7-10-2024"
#Description: I have up until this point organized all of my empirical results on sheets 
#in folders.  Now, I want to centralize all of those results.
# I am going to estimate the effects for all major tax bases 
#(CIT, Income, Sales, Severance, Everything not CIT).  
#I will estimate results with the following techniques: 2WFE, DiD, Synthetic Control, sDiD
# I want to estimate all of the results for each state in Block Treatment for sDiD
#Do this for each base, note and create major plots.  No need to mass produce other plots
# that will not get used.

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}

#Load Packages
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyverse)
library(lmtest)
library(ggplot2)
library(did) # for running DiD
library(plm)
library(lmtest)
library(synthdid)
library(fixest)

# set seed
set.seed(26)
#JMP Directory
setwd("~/Documents/GitHub/ST-Apportionment/job_market_data")

#Load Detrended, per capita, real revenue data
Rev <- read.csv("detrend_per_capita.csv")

#Remove X and X.1, REMOVE COLUMN when saving
#note, row names =FALSE did not work, still have an X
Rev <- Rev %>%
  select(-X,-X.1)

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
